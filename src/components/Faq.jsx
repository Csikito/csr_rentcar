                  You need a valid driver's license held for at least 1 year,
                  depending on the car category. You might also need an
                  International Driving Permit or official translation of the
                  license.

                  Prepaid Bookings: You'll pay when you book online. Remember
                  that although your booking has been paid for, the main driver
                  will still be required to have a credit card in their name on
                  collection in order to pick up the car.

                  You can find car rental deals by researching online and
                  comparing prices from different rental companies. Websites
                  such as Expedia, Kayak, and Travelocity allow you to compare
                  prices and view available rental options. It is also
                  recommended to sign up for email newsletters and follow rental
                  car companies on social media to be informed of any special
                  deals or promotions.
